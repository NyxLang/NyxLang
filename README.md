# Nyx Programming Language

This is the canonical implementation of the Nyx programming language. Its behavior should be considered canonical until a working language specification is defined.

## About Nyx

Nyx is a hybrid functional and object-oriented programming language that basically takes what the maintainer (Jason Barr, jason@jasonsbarr.com) thinks are the best parts of various languages, including Python, Ruby, Swift, Elm, ReasonML, Julia, and Racket, puts them in a cup, shakes it, and then pours it out to see what happens.

## Disclaimer

**EVERYTHING IS IN FLUX.** I basically started writing an interpreter to see if I could make certain things work (e.g. syntactically-significant whitespace), and then at some point I decided to rewrite things and think more about what exactly I wanted the language to be like. As long as this disclaimer is here, you should just assume everything is broken. I'm basically learning about programming language implementation as I go, so this should be a fun adventure!

## Current TODO list

- Create a more well-defined specification
- Rebuild everything
